# The URL Data Connector

The URL data connector provides connectors, query builders and model builders for URL-based data sources - mainly web services.

These types of web services are supported by default:

- REST-like web services based on JSON or XML
- [OData version 2 and 4](OData/index.md) with JSON-support. For SAP OData services - refer to the [SAP Connector](https://github.com/ExFace/SapConnector/blob/master/Docs/Connecting_via_oData/index.md).
- Websites with more or less valid HTML or XHTML
- JSON files (local or remote)
